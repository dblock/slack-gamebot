This command can also update a user's registration, for example after the user has been renamed. The bot notices user renames, but this may be necessary if the bot wasn't running during that operation.

```
gamebot register

Welcome back Victor Barna! I've updated your registration.
```

You can also remove yourself from the leaderboard with `gamebot unregister me` and re-register youself again with `gamebot register`.
The data is not removed, but the user will no longer appear in the leaderboards and cannot participate in challenges.

2. Deng Yaping: 1 win, 3 losses (elo: 24)
3. Wang Hoe: 0 wins, 1 loss (elo: -12)
```

The leaderboard contains 3 topmost players ranked by [Elo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), use _leaderboard 10_ or _leaderboard infinity_ to see 10 players or more, respectively. It also shows the longest winning (lws) and losing (lls) streaks of at least 3.

In case you want to see leaderboard in reverse order (which would be totally wrong but motivational for people at the bottom of leaderboard), specify a negative number or `-infinity`:

```
gamebot leaderboard -5

1. Wang Hoe: 0 wins, 1 loss (elo: -12)
2. Deng Yaping: 1 win, 3 losses (elo: 24)
3. Victor Barna: 3 wins, 2 losses (elo: 148, lws: 5)

## API

Slack-gamebot implements a Hypermedia API. Navigate to the application root to browse through available objects and methods. PlayPlay.io's Gamebot is [here](http://www.playplay.io/api), you can see [dblock's current ping-pong elo here](http://www.playplay.io/api/users/5543f64d6237640003000000).

A team captain must opt-in serving data via the API with `set api on`. The data served by the API includes team's Slack IDs, usernames and game stats.

![](screenshots/api.png)

We recommend [HyperClient](https://github.com/codegram/hyperclient) to query the API programmatically in Ruby.
